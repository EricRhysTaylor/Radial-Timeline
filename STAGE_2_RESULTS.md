# Stage 2 Testing Results - ModeManager Integration

**Date**: [Fill in date]  
**Obsidian Version**: [e.g., v1.4.16]  
**macOS Version**: [e.g., 25.0.0]  
**Plugin Version**: Current development build (Stage 2)

**Goal**: Verify that mode switching now goes through `ModeManager` while rendering still uses old code (dual system).

---

## What Changed in Stage 2

‚úÖ **Mode switching** now uses `ModeManager`  
‚úÖ **Gossamer enter/exit** now uses `ModeManager`  
‚è≥ **Rendering logic** still uses old code (unchanged from Stage 1)  
‚è≥ **Interactions** still use old code (unchanged from Stage 1)

**Expected Result**: Everything should work exactly like Stage 1, just with cleaner mode switching under the hood.

## Developer Reference

### What ModeManager Does (Behind the Scenes)

When you switch modes now, `ModeManager`:
1. ‚úÖ Executes `onExit` lifecycle hook for current mode
2. ‚úÖ Updates `view.currentMode` property
3. ‚úÖ Syncs legacy properties (`outerRingAllScenes`, `interactionMode`)
4. ‚úÖ Persists mode to settings file
5. ‚úÖ Executes `onEnter` lifecycle hook for new mode
6. ‚úÖ Triggers `refreshTimeline()` to re-render

### Fallback Behavior

If `ModeManager` is not available (shouldn't happen):
- Falls back to legacy mode switching
- Direct property manipulation
- Manual refresh calls
- Still works correctly (backward compatible)
