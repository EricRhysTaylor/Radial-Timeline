**Welcome to the Radial Timeline Wiki!**

Radial Timeline™ transforms your manuscript into a live visual map where you can see your entire story structure at a glance.

### What It Does
Radial Timeline™ arranges your scenes by act, subplot, narrative or chronological order in a striking radial layout—revealing the structure, rhythm, and scope of your story. Each ring represents a subplot; hover interactions surface important details like scene synopsis and story beats. Scenes highlight across subplots to show interrelationships. Multiple view modes dissect your novel like an X-ray.

### The 4 Critical Timelines
Radial Timeline™ captures and visualizes all 4 critical timelines:
*   **Narrative time**: the sequence you reveal events to readers.
*   **Chronological time**: when events happen in your story's world.
*   **Author time**: your real-world writing progress toward completion from Todo to Complete.
*   **Publishing time**: manuscript revision stages from Zero draft through Press-ready.
