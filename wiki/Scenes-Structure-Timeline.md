# Scenes, Structure, and the Timeline

If you’re starting a fresh vault, you can keep this simple. Radial Timeline is built around three ideas that work together: scenes, structure, and the timeline view.

## Scenes
A scene is just a note. The main body is your prose. At the top, you can add **scene details** when you want to track things like acts, subplots, or characters. (In Obsidian, those details are stored as **YAML front matter**.)

## Structure
Structure is the framework that helps you see your story clearly. In Radial Timeline, structure can mean **Acts**, a **story beat system**, and **Subplots**. It can also include **Backdrop** and **Micro Backdrops** as part of narrative structure. You don’t have to finalize any of this up front. Use **Book Designer** if you want a starting framework, then refine it as you go.

## Timeline
The timeline is a visual map of your story. You can reorder and explore scenes in the timeline without shuffling files around. File order stays stable while story order stays flexible.

## Fresh Vault, Quick Start
1. Create your first scene note.
2. Write a bit of prose.
3. Add structure only when it helps you think.
