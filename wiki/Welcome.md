# Welcome to Radial Timeline

Radial Timeline is a writing system that transforms how you visualize, organize, and structure narrative work. Think of it as a living manuscript where your story breathes and evolves alongside your creativity.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to begin is to **create your first scene** using the command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + P`) and selecting **Radial Timeline: Create basic scene note**. This gives you a place to write immediately—no elaborate setup required.

If you prefer to establish a framework first, use the **[[Book-Designer|Book Designer]]** button on the welcome screen. Book Designer lets you specify the number of template scenes, dummy scenes, and the anticipated last scene of your story, along with optional subplots, characters, and time increments for each scene. This creates a framework model for your book and demonstrates Radial Timeline's capabilities out of the box. You can then delete scenes or start filling them in at your leisure.

Once you have a scene, open it and start writing. Scene details—like the characters in the scene, subplot assignments, or structural beats—can stay blank until you're ready to add them.

As your manuscript grows, you'll add new scenes, view them in the Radial Timeline, and reorganize them as needed. The timeline is where you do most things, including reordering scenes. You can create new scenes from scratch or duplicate existing ones to build out your story.

## Protecting Your Work

Your manuscript deserves protection. Back up your Obsidian vault regularly—sync alone won't guard against all forms of data loss. Obsidian provides a [comprehensive backup guide](https://help.obsidian.md/backup), and services like [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) or the [Obsidian Git plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-git) make this seamless.

## Exploring the Documentation

The wiki organizes resources by how you work, not by feature lists. **[[Scenes-Structure-Timeline|Scenes, Structure, and the Timeline]]** offers a gentle primer if you're starting fresh. Writers migrating from Scrivener or similar tools will find **[[Migrating-from-Other-Apps|Migrating from Other Apps]]** helpful for understanding Obsidian's markdown-based workflow.

For hands-on guidance, **[[Fresh-Vault-Onboarding|Fresh Vault Onboarding]]** walks you through building a new manuscript with Book Designer and structural beats, while **[[Existing-Vault-Onboarding|Existing Vault Onboarding]]** shows how to connect notes you've already written. Once you're comfortable, **[[Core-Workflows|Core Workflows]]** reveals techniques for planning, drafting, and tracking progress across your novel.

As your needs deepen, explore **[[Timeline-Modes|Timeline Modes]]** to visualize your story through Narrative, Publication, Chronologue, and Gossamer views. The **[[Inquiry]]** tools help you analyze scenes and themes, while the **[[Author-Progress-Report|Author Progress Report]]** tracks your drafting and revision momentum.

Advanced writers can dive into **[[YAML-Frontmatter|Scene YAML]]** for full schema control and custom fields, consult the **[[Commands]]** reference for command palette shortcuts, or experiment with **[[AI-Analysis|AI Analysis]]** workflows to unlock optional scene analysis features.
