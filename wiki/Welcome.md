# Welcome to Radial Timeline

Radial Timeline is a writing system that transforms how you visualize, organize, and structure narrative work. Think of it as a living manuscript where your story breathes and evolves alongside your creativity.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to begin is to **create your first scene**. Use the button on the welcome screen or open the command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + P`) and select **Radial Timeline: Create basic scene note**. This gives you a place to write immediately—no elaborate setup required.

If you prefer to establish a framework first, the **[[Book-Designer|Book Designer]]** helps you sketch out acts, subplots, characters, and optional beats in just a few minutes. Either approach works; the system adapts to your creative process rather than forcing a single workflow.

Once you have a scene, open it and start writing. Scene details—like character tags, subplot markers, or structural beats—can stay blank until you need them. Your files stay where you put them in your vault, while the timeline shows you the story order you define.

As your manuscript grows, you'll refine the structure in **Settings → Core** or return to Book Designer whenever inspiration strikes. The framework evolves with your story, not against it.

## Protecting Your Work

Your manuscript deserves protection. Back up your Obsidian vault regularly—sync alone won't guard against all forms of data loss. Obsidian provides a [comprehensive backup guide](https://help.obsidian.md/backup), and services like [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) or the [Obsidian Git plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-git) make this seamless.

## Exploring the Documentation

The wiki organizes resources by how you work, not by feature lists. **[[Scenes-Structure-Timeline|Scenes, Structure, and the Timeline]]** offers a gentle primer if you're starting fresh. Writers migrating from Scrivener or similar tools will find **[[Migrating-from-Other-Apps|Migrating from Other Apps]]** helpful for understanding Obsidian's markdown-based workflow.

For hands-on guidance, **[[Fresh-Vault-Onboarding|Fresh Vault Onboarding]]** walks you through building a new manuscript with Book Designer and structural beats, while **[[Existing-Vault-Onboarding|Existing Vault Onboarding]]** shows how to connect notes you've already written. Once you're comfortable, **[[Core-Workflows|Core Workflows]]** reveals techniques for planning, drafting, and tracking progress across your novel.

As your needs deepen, explore **[[Timeline-Modes|Timeline Modes]]** to visualize your story through Narrative, Publication, Chronologue, and Gossamer views. The **[[Inquiry]]** tools help you analyze scenes and themes, while the **[[Author-Progress-Report|Author Progress Report]]** tracks your drafting and revision momentum.

Advanced writers can dive into **[[YAML-Frontmatter|Scene YAML]]** for full schema control and custom fields, consult the **[[Commands]]** reference for command palette shortcuts, or experiment with **[[AI-Analysis|AI Analysis]]** workflows to unlock optional scene analysis features.
