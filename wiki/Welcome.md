# Welcome Screen

Radial Timeline is a writing system for visualizing, organizing, and structuring a narrative as a living manuscript.
You’ll set up a bit of story structure early—this usually takes about five minutes.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin: 20px 0;">

    <img src="images/welcome.png" alt="Radial Timeline welcome screen with quick-start guide" style="width: 640px; max-width: 100%; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 6px 14px rgba(0,0,0,0.12);" />

## Primary Action

**Create your first scene** — Use the button on the welcome screen, or the command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + P`) → **Radial Timeline: Create basic scene note**.

## Secondary Actions

*   **Design a story framework** — Launch **[[Book-Designer|Book Designer]]** to set up acts, subplots, characters, and optional beats as a starting point.
*   **How scenes, structure, and the timeline work** — Start with **[[Scenes-Structure-Timeline|Scenes, Structure, and the Timeline]]**.

## First Session in Three Steps

### 1. Create your first scene
Start a scene so you have a place to write. Choose where your scenes live in your vault, then create your first scene note.

*(This folder is called the Source path in Settings → Core → General.)*

### 2. Write prose immediately
Open the scene and start writing. You can leave scene details blank until you need them.

### 3. Shape the story structure
Design the framework and refine it as you go.

*   **Design the framework** — Use Book Designer to set up acts, subplots, characters, and optional beats as a starting point.
*   **Refine structure later** — Adjust acts and beats anytime in **Settings → Core**.

Scenes are reordered and explored visually in the timeline—file order stays stable while story order stays flexible.

## Backup & Sync

Back up your Obsidian vault regularly to protect against data loss. Sync does not protect against all forms of data loss.

*   **[Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync)** or **[Obsidian Git](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-git)**
