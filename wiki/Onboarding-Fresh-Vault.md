# Fresh Vault Onboarding

Use this path when you are starting a new project or an empty vault.

## Common Obsidian Setup Paths
Radial Timeline works well with a few common vault setups. Pick one and stick with it:

- Single book vault. Cleanest and simplest for a new project.
- Single vault with a dedicated Manuscript folder. Keeps research notes separate.
- Multi-book vault with one folder per book. Best when you are planning a series.

This page covers the fresh vault flow. If you already have scenes, jump to [[Onboarding-Existing-Vault|Existing Vault Onboarding]].

## 1. Install and point the plugin
1. Install Radial Timeline from Community Plugins.
2. Open Settings -> Community Plugins -> Radial Timeline.
3. Set **Source path** to your Manuscript folder or vault root.

## 2. Generate your scaffold with Book Designer
1. Open the command palette and run **Radial Timeline: Book designer**.
2. Choose Act count, subplot count, and optional beats.
3. Click Create to generate your scene notes and optional beat notes.

## 3. Choose a beats system (or skip for now)
- Pick Save the Cat, Hero's Journey, Story Grid, or Custom in Settings -> Core -> Story beats system.
- For Custom: name your system, add beats, assign to acts, and drag to reorder.
- If you skipped beats in Book Designer, use **Create** to generate beat template notes later. Use **Merge** to realign files after reordering or renaming.

## 4. Orient to the key modes
- Narrative (1). Manuscript order and subplot structure.
- Publication (2). Writing status and publish stage.
- Chronologue (3). Story-world time.
- Gossamer (4). Beat momentum and scoring.

## 5. Minimum daily workflow
- Write scenes and keep `Synopsis` up to date.
- Update `Status` as you move from Todo to Working to Complete.
- Use Search to find scenes across metadata fields.

## 6. Optional next steps
- Run **AI Analysis** for scene pulse feedback.
- Use **Inquiry** for corpus-level analysis.
- Use **Manuscript export** when you are ready to share.
