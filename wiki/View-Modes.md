### Narrative Mode (keyboard 1)
Shows all scenes from all subplots on the outer ring with story beats and subplot color-coding. Structured around your configured **act count** (default 3) with scenes organized by act divisions (\(360° / \text{Act Count}\)). Provides comprehensive view with every detail. This is your primary manuscript-order workspace showing **Narrative time** (reading order). Status/publishing overlays are hidden so subplot colors remain dominant.

**Interactive Reordering**: You can reorder scenes by dragging the scene number squares on the outer ring. See [[How-to#reorder-scenes]] for details.

**Tip**: For scenes in more than one subplot, click on the scene to make that subplot dominant in the color styling of the narrative and chronologue modes outer ring. A folded corner effect at the beginning of the subplot ring visually indicates which subplot is currently dominant.

### Subplot Mode (keyboard 2)
Isolates each subplot into its own unitary radial pass—no combined outer ring—so you can focus on one thread at a time. Scenes inherit the author workflow palette (Todo plaid, Working pink, Overdue red, Complete = publish-stage color) along with publish-stage indicators. Removes story beats for a cleaner view. Structured around your configured **act count** (default 3) with acts spanning \(360° / \text{Act Count}\). Simplified view emphasizing **Author time** (writing status) and **Publishing time** (revision stages) and completion readiness. Use the top-right navigation or keyboard 2 to cycle between subplots.

### Chronologue Mode (keyboard 3)
Displays scenes in chronological story order based on `When` field. **Removes act divisions** entirely—scenes are positioned across the full 360° circle based solely on when they occur in your story's timeline. Color styling mirrors Narrative mode (subplot colors only) to keep time comparisons clean.

*   **Shift Mode** (keyboard **Shift**, **caps lock** or click button): wireframe view revealing the chronological backbone.
*   **Discontinuities**: Large time jumps marked with ∞ symbol.
*   **Smart duration labels**: Time-period-appropriate formatting.
*   **Dynamic duration arc cap**: Proportionally scales scene durations.

### Gossamer Mode (keyboard 4)
Visualizes narrative momentum using story beat scores. Timeline grays out; momentum values display across story beats.
