## Custom Calendars & Alien Time

Radial Timeline does not support fully custom calendar systems (for example, calendars based on alien star systems, non-Earth day lengths, or culturally specific time units) for timeline planning.

This is a deliberate design decision. While alien calendars are often an important part of worldbuilding, they are not well suited to the structural tasks Radial Timeline is designed to support: narrative sequencing, pacing analysis, and subplot coordination.

---

### Design Rationale

When plotting a story, authors need a temporal reference frame that allows for fast, intuitive reasoning about duration and spacing.

For most authors on Earth, that reference frame is the standard Earth-based time system (days, weeks, months, years). These units are deeply internalized and allow authors to evaluate pacing and narrative pressure without constant translation. No doubt, in 100 years, there will be authors on Mars using the Martian calendar to plan their novels. That's the way it should be.

Introducing a fully custom calendar into the planning layer would require authors to repeatedly convert between unfamiliar units in order to answer basic structural questions, increasing cognitive overhead during development.

Radial Timeline prioritizes reducing that overhead.

---

### Separation of Structure and Presentation

Radial Timeline intentionally distinguishes between:

- **Structural time** — used for planning, analysis, and comparison  
- **In-world time** — used for narrative texture, immersion, and worldbuilding  

Custom calendars belong primarily to the latter.

While a fictional setting may include unique astronomical cycles, cultural calendars, or locally defined units of time, those systems are most effective when expressed in the prose, not when used as the underlying units for timeline computation.

### How Published Science Fiction Handles Time

In practice, most published science fiction separates story structure from in-world timekeeping:

- Narrative planning and pacing rely on familiar temporal units.
- Fictional calendars and time references appear in dialogue, exposition, and scene description.
- Readers infer urgency and duration through context rather than explicit conversion.

This separation allows authors to maintain clarity during development while still presenting rich and internally consistent worlds on the page.

---

### Environmental Cycles Without Custom Calendars

Alien time does not need to be numeric to be meaningful.

Many science-fiction settings emphasize lived temporal experience rather than formal calendars, such as:

- Extremely long or uneven solar days  
- Apparent solar reversals or stalled suns  
- Tidal cycles that define travel or labor windows  
- Cultural markers tied to light, heat, or shadow  

These phenomena shape character behavior, social structures, and conflict without requiring a non-intuitive calendrical system in the planning layer.

---

### Recommended Workflow

#### 1. Plan in Earth Time

Use standard units (days, weeks, months) to evaluate:

- Narrative pacing  
- Recovery time between events  
- Overlap and intersection of plotlines  

These units allow rapid structural judgment.

---

#### 2. Translate in the Prose

When writing scenes, express duration using in-world language and phenomena:

- Lunar cycles  
- Solar positions  
- Environmental or cultural markers  

This is where alien time becomes visible to the reader.

---

### Summary

Radial Timeline focuses on the architecture of a story: sequencing, spacing, overlap, and escalation.

Alien calendars, solar anomalies, and environmental cycles remain essential to worldbuilding and should appear in the prose, where they shape experience and meaning.

They are intentionally excluded from the timeline's computational layer to preserve clarity, speed, and intuitive reasoning during story development.

## I Use the Snowflake Method

**Q: I use the Snowflake Method and don't think the Radial Timeline will be useful to me.**

**A:** Radial Timeline is structure-agnostic and works well with the Snowflake Method—particularly once you reach Steps 8–10 (scene spreadsheet, scene narratives, and first draft).

The Snowflake Method is a *planning process* that expands a one-sentence idea into a full manuscript. Radial Timeline is a *visualization and analysis layer* that sits on top of your scenes regardless of how you developed them.

Here's how the two complement each other:

| Snowflake Step | What It Produces | Radial Timeline Feature |
|---|---|---|
| Step 8: Scene spreadsheet | List of discrete scenes | Core radial visualization |
| Step 9: Scene narratives | Scene content | Scene notes with YAML metadata |
| Step 10: First draft | Actual manuscript | Full manuscript support |

### Why Radial Timeline Works for Snowflake Users

1. **No beat system required** — Do not create beats notes or set the story structure to "Custom" and create your own. The timeline visualizes your scenes regardless of methodology or momentum milestones.

2. **Snowflake is character-centric—so is Radial Timeline** — POV color-coding and subplot tracking align perfectly with Snowflake's emphasis on character storylines. Each character's arc can be tracked as a subplot with its own color.

3. **Your scene spreadsheet becomes visual** — Step 8 of Snowflake creates a scene list. Radial Timeline transforms that flat list into a radial visualization where you can see pacing, gaps, and scene distribution at a glance.

4. **Chronologue mode for timeline complexity** — If your story has non-linear time (flashbacks, multiple timelines), Chronologue tracks story-time vs manuscript-order—useful regardless of planning method.

5. **AI analysis works on any scenes** — Scene triplet analysis provides concise pulse feedback on a scene level while Gossamer AI evalution takes your beat milestones and evaluates overall story punch.

### Summary

The Snowflake Method gets you from idea to scene list. Radial Timeline takes that scene list and gives you visual tools to analyze structure, track characters, manage subplots, and refine pacing. They work together rather than competing.
