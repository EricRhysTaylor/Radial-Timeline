# Advanced YAML & Data Integrity

The Advanced YAML editor allows you to define custom fields for your scenes, enabling you to track specific metrics or properties unique to your workflow (e.g., Story Grid values, Dramatica signposts).

## Data Integrity & Backups

When heavily customizing YAML keys or using advanced plugins, it is crucial to protect your work against data loss or corruption.

**Recommendation:**
Use a reliable backup solution.
*   **Obsidian Sync**: Ensure "Plugin settings" and "Active core/community plugins" are checked in your Sync settings to back up your Radial Timeline configuration.
*   **External Backups**: If using third-party sync (Dropbox, Drive), consider keeping a local backup or using the **Local File History** core plugin.

**Mac/iCloud Users:**
To prevent iCloud sync conflicts from corrupting plugin data, you can append `.nosync` to folder names (e.g., `radial-backups.nosync`) to exclude them from iCloud syncing while keeping them in your vault.
