### Screen resolution suggestions
The radial timeline is designed for high pixel density displays (around 200 ppi or higher) for optimal visual quality.
*   All Apple Retina displays — 2x pixel density.
*   Recommend Windows systems with 4k displays or higher. (Tested on 1080p 2550x1440)
*   Tablets.

If you're experiencing visual quality issues on Windows, please check your display scaling settings.

### Technical implementation
The radial timeline visualization was inspired by and draws on principles from d3.js.
*   SVG-based visualization techniques
*   Data-driven document manipulation
*   Interactive elements with hover and click behaviors
*   Radial layouts and polar coordinates
*   Scale transformations and data mapping
*   Dynamic color manipulation and pattern generation

Built using pure SVG and javascript, fully compatible with Obsidian's document object model.
