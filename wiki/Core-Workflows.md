### Planning Your Novel
*   **Act Structure**: Create and distribute scenes by act (1-3) to see your three-act structure take shape as scene ideas come to you.
*   **Subplot Tracking**: Each ring represents a different subplot. Keep scenes in a single subplot or spread them across multiple subplots to see how plot threads interweave with thoughtful scene subplot placement.
*   **Story Beats**: Use story beat systems (Save the Cat, Hero's Journey, Story Grid, or Custom) to lay out the momentum scaffolding.
*   **Backdrop**: Whether it's the sun setting for a half year (north or south pole) or a sun reigniting after centuries of dormancy in an exotic star system, mark major plot backdrop events using the special context ring placed below the outer ring.

### Tracking Progress
*   **Status Colors**: In **Subplot Mode - 2**, scenes are color-coded by status (Todo = plaid, Working = pink, Overdue = red, Complete = publish stage color customizable in settings). In Narrative and Chronologue modes, scenes display their subplot color.
*   **Completion Estimates**: Plugin calculates target completion date based on your recent writing pace. The calculated is most accurate when the `Due` date is updated to the day of scene completion.
*   **Capture actual completion dates**: When you mark a scene as `Complete`, update its `Due` date to the day you finished. Those timestamps power the completion estimate calculations, so keeping them current improves the forecast.
*   **Publishing Stages**: Track manuscript through Zero → Author → House → Press.
*   **Subplot Mode**: Switch to subplot mode (navigation top right via page icon or keyboard 2) for a per-subplot view (no combined outer ring) that emphasizes publication progress and Todo/Working/Overdue status patterns.

**Modes**: Narrative (key 1) or Subplot (key 2)
**Settings**: Publishing stage colors

### Generating a Manuscript

When you're ready to read through your work or send it to an editor, use the **`Generate manuscript`** command.

1.  Open the command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + P`) and select **`Radial Timeline: Generate manuscript`**.
2.  **Order**: Choose from Narrative, Chronological, Reverse Narrative, or Reverse Chronological ordering.
3.  **Subplot Filter**: Optionally filter to compile only scenes from a specific subplot.
4.  **TOC**: Select Markdown, Plain Text, or No Table of Contents.
5.  **Range**: Use the drag-bar slider to visually select a specific range of scenes to include (useful for generating a single act or particular range of scenes).
6.  **Output**: A new file is created in the `AI/` folder containing the compiled text of all selected scenes.

### Zero Draft Mode
Prevents edits to completed zero-draft scenes. Click completed scene → modal for pending edits → save ideas for later revision. Keeps you progress to new scenes instead of endlessly revising. See the **[Settings](Settings#zero-draft-mode)** for details.

**Settings**: → Radial Timeline → Zero draft mode
