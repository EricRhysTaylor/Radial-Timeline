### Planning Your Novel
*   **Story Beats**: Use any story beat system (Save the Cat, Hero's Journey, Story Grid, or Custom) to lay out the story momentum scaffolding.
*   **Act Structure**: Create and distribute scenes by act (1-3) to see your three-act structure take shape as scene ideas come to you.
*   **Subplot Tracking**: Each ring represents a different subplot—see how plot threads interweave.
*   **Beat Templates**: Generate complete story beat sets like Save the Cat using Settings → Story beat system.

**Command**: `Create template scene note`
**Settings**: `Story beat system`

### Tracking Progress
*   **Status Colors**: In **Subplot Mode**, scenes are color-coded by status (Todo = plaid, Working = pink, Overdue = red, Complete = publish stage color customizable in settings). In Narrative and Chronologue modes, scenes display their subplot color.
*   **Completion Estimates**: Plugin calculates target completion date based on your recent writing pace.
*   **Capture actual completion dates**: When you mark a scene as `Complete`, update its `Due` date to the day you finished. Those timestamps power the completion estimate calculations, so keeping them current improves the forecast.
*   **Publishing Stages**: Track manuscript through Zero → Author → House → Press.
*   **Subplot Mode**: Switch to subplot mode (navigation top right via page icon or keyboard 2) for a per-subplot view (no combined outer ring) that emphasizes publication progress and Todo/Working/Overdue status patterns.

**Modes**: Narrative (key 1) or Subplot (key 2)
**Settings**: Publishing stage colors

### Generating a Manuscript

When you're ready to read through your work or send it to an editor, use the **`Generate manuscript`** command.

1.  Open the command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + P`) and select **`Radial Timeline: Generate manuscript`**.
2.  **Order**: Choose Narrative (reading order) or Chronological (story-world order).
3.  **TOC**: Select Markdown, Plain Text, or No Table of Contents.
4.  **Range**: Use the slider to select a specific range of scenes to include (useful for generating a single act or chapter).
5.  **Output**: A new file is created in the `AI/` folder containing the compiled text of all selected scenes.

### Zero Draft Mode
Prevents edits to completed zero-draft scenes. Click completed scene → modal for pending edits → save ideas for later revision. Keeps you progress to new scenes instead of endlessly revising. See the **[Zero Draft Mode](Zero-Draft-Mode)** guide for full details.

**Settings**: → Radial Timeline → Zero draft mode
