**Analyzing Narrative Momentum**

Gossamer Mode visualizes narrative momentum using story beat scores. Timeline grays out; momentum values display across story beats to show tension/excitement building.

*   **Momentum Tracking**: Chart narrative momentum across story beats and over time with manual score entry.
*   **Historical tracking**: Compare momentum scores across up to 30 iterations to track how your story evolves.
*   **Ideal Range**: Based on `Range=0-20` yaml for each story beat creating an idealized story momentum shape.
*   **Manual score entry**: Track momentum changes over time with suggested LLM prompt.

**Modes**: Gossamer mode (key **4**)
**Command**: `Gossamer enter momentum scores`
**Settings**: `Story beats system`
