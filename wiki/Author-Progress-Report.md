# Author Progress Report (APR)

The Author Progress Report is a shareable, spoiler-safe graphic that shows your book's progress without revealing story details. Perfect for Kickstarter updates, Patreon posts, newsletters, and social media.

## Progress Calculation

APR uses a **weighted stage-based** approach to calculate your book's completion percentage. Each scene contributes based on its Publish Stage:

| Publish Stage | Contribution |
|---------------|--------------|
| Zero (First Draft) | 25% |
| Author (Self-Revision) | 50% |
| House (Editor Revision) | 75% |
| Press (Publication Ready) | 100% |

**Example**: A book with 100 scenes where:
- 50 scenes are at Zero -> 50 x 0.25 = 12.5%
- 30 scenes are at Author -> 30 x 0.50 = 15%
- 15 scenes are at House -> 15 x 0.75 = 11.25%
- 5 scenes are at Press -> 5 x 1.00 = 5%
- **Total Progress: 44%**

This gives fans a realistic view of multi-stage publishing progress rather than just counting "done" scenes.

> **Note**: This calculation is intentionally separate from the main timeline's Estimated Completion feature, which uses velocity-based projections for date estimation.

## Reveal Options

Control how much of your story structure is visible:

| Option | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Subplots** | Multiple concentric rings for each subplot |
| **Acts** | Act boundary spokes dividing the timeline |
| **Status Colors** | Scene stage/status colors (Todo, Draft, Complete, etc.) |
| **% Complete** | Large percentage number in the center |

**Tip**: Uncheck all options for a simple progress ring—perfect for early teasers or minimal updates. Manual reveal options are disabled when Teaser Reveal is enabled.

## Teaser Reveal (Pro)

For campaigns, enable **Teaser Reveal** to automatically show more detail as your book progresses.

Reveal stages:

| Stage | Shows |
|-------|-------|
| Teaser | Progress ring only |
| Scenes | Scene cells (no colors) |
| Colors | Scene cells with status colors |
| Full | Complete timeline with subplots and acts |

Preset schedules:
- **Slow**: 15%, 40%, 70%
- **Standard**: 10%, 30%, 60% (default)
- **Fast**: 5%, 20%, 45%
- **Custom**: Set your own thresholds (1-99%)

You can click the middle stages in the preview (Scenes, Colors) to skip them and jump to the next stage.
