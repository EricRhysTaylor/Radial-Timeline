# Author Progress Report (APR)

The Author Progress Report is a shareable, spoiler-safe graphic that shows your book's progress without revealing story details. Perfect for Kickstarter updates, Patreon posts, newsletters, and social media.

## Progress Calculation

APR uses a **weighted stage-based** approach to calculate your book's completion percentage. Each scene contributes based on its Publish Stage:

| Publish Stage | Contribution |
|---------------|--------------|
| Zero (First Draft) | 25% |
| Author (Self-Revision) | 50% |
| House (Editor Revision) | 75% |
| Press (Publication Ready) | 100% |

**Example**: A book with 100 scenes where:
- 50 scenes are at Zero → 50 × 0.25 = 12.5%
- 30 scenes are at Author → 30 × 0.50 = 15%
- 15 scenes are at House → 15 × 0.75 = 11.25%
- 5 scenes are at Press → 5 × 1.00 = 5%
- **Total Progress: 44%**

This gives fans a realistic view of multi-stage publishing progress rather than just counting "done" scenes.

> **Note**: This calculation is intentionally separate from the main timeline's Estimated Completion feature, which uses velocity-based projections for date estimation.

## Reveal Options

Control how much of your story structure is visible:

| Option | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Subplots** | Multiple concentric rings for each subplot |
| **Acts** | Act boundary spokes dividing the timeline |
| **Status Colors** | Scene stage/status colors (Todo, Draft, Complete, etc.) |
| **% Complete** | Large percentage number in the center |

**Tip**: Uncheck all options for a simple progress ring—perfect for early teasers or minimal updates.

## Teaser Reveal (Pro)

For campaigns, enable **Teaser Reveal** to automatically show more detail as your book progresses:

| Level | Threshold | Shows |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Teaser | 0% | Progress ring only |
| Scenes | 10% | Scene cells (no colors) |
| Colors | 25% | Scene cells with status colors |
| Structure | 50% | Scenes + colors + act boundaries |
| Full | 75% | Complete timeline with subplots |

This creates anticipation as your audience sees more of your timeline structure as you approach completion.

## Export Sizes

| Size | Dimensions | Best For |
|------|------------|----------|
| Compact | 600×600px | Social media posts, thumbnails |
| Standard | 800×800px | Blog posts, newsletters |
| Large | 1000×1000px | Website embeds, high-res displays |

## Styling Options

- **Transparent Background**: Recommended for embedding on any background
- **Background Color**: Use when transparency isn't supported
- **Theme Contrast**: Light or dark strokes for visibility against your background
- **Book/Author Color**: Color for the perimeter text ring
