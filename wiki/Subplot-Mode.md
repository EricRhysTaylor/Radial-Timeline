# Subplot Mode

**Keyboard Shortcut**: `2`

Subplot Mode isolates each subplot into its own radial pass, removing the combined outer ring. This mode focuses on **Author time** (your writing status) and **Publishing time** (revision stages), making it ideal for tracking progress.

</div>

## Key Features

*   **Single Thread Focus**: View one subplot at a time to analyze its specific arc and continuity.
*   **3-Act Structure**: Like Narrative Mode, scenes are distributed across three acts (120° per act).
*   **Cleaner View**: Removes story beats to reduce visual noise while you focus on workflow.

## Workflow Visualization

Unlike Narrative Mode, this view replaces subplot colors with your workflow status:

1.  **Author Status**:
    *   **Todo**: Plaid pattern.
    *   **Working**: Pink.
    *   **Overdue**: Red.
    *   **Complete**: Inherits the color of the scene Publishing Stage.

2.  **Publishing Stage Colors**:
    *   Once a scene is "Complete", it displays the color of its current stage (Zero Draft, Author's Draft, House Edit, Press Ready).
    *   These colors can be customized in [[Settings]].

This mode effectively becomes your project management dashboard, highlighting what needs to be written, what is overdue, and what is ready for the next stage of editing.
