# Publication Mode (formerly Subplot)

**Keyboard Shortcut**: `2`

Publication Mode isolates each subplot into its own radial pass, removing the combined outer ring. This mode focuses on **Author time** (your writing status) and **Publishing time** (revision stages), making it ideal for tracking progress.

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="images/subplot.jpeg" alt="Publication Mode" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;" />
</div>

## Key Features

*   **Single Thread Focus**: View one subplot at a time to analyze its specific arc and continuity.
*   **Act Structure**: Like Narrative Mode, scenes are distributed across your configured act count (default 3). Each act spans \(360° / \text{Act Count}\).
*   **Cleaner View**: Removes story beats to reduce visual noise while you focus on workflow.

## Workflow Visualization

Unlike Narrative Mode, this view replaces subplot colors with your workflow status:

1.  **Author Status**:
    *   **Todo**: Plaid pattern.
    *   **Working**: Pink.
    *   **Overdue**: Red.
    *   **Complete**: Inherits the color of the scene Publishing Stage.

2.  **Publishing Stage Colors**:
    *   Once a scene is "Complete", it displays the color of its current stage (Zero Draft, Author's Draft, House Edit, Press Ready).
    *   These colors can be customized in [[Settings]].

This mode effectively becomes your project management dashboard, highlighting what needs to be written, what is overdue, and what is ready for the next stage of editing.
