# Narrative Mode

**Keyboard Shortcut**: `1`

Narrative Mode is your primary manuscript-order workspace. It displays all scenes from all subplots on the outer ring, organized by **act divisions** (default 3 acts, configurable in **Settings → Acts**). Each act spans an equal segment of the 360° circle. This view emphasizes **Narrative time** (the order readers will experience the story).

## Key Features

*   **Structure**: Scenes are distributed across Act 1..Act N (based on your **Settings → Acts → Act count**).
*   **Subplot Colors**: The outer ring segments are colored by their subplot. This lets you quickly visualize which plot threads are dominant in each section of the book.
*   **Story Beats**: Displays story beats (like Save the Cat) along the timeline, helping you pace your narrative structure.
*   **Interactive Reordering**: You can drag scenes on the outer ring to reorder them. See [[How-to#reorder-scenes]] for details.

## Dominant Subplots

When a scene belongs to multiple subplots, the outer All Scenes ring must choose one color. You control which subplot wins:

*   **Click a scene**: Sets its dominant subplot. That subplot's color is used for the scene on the outer ring, taking precedence over all others.
*   **Folded corner indicator**: Each subplot ring shows a small folded corner motif at its start. The corner has three states:
    *   **Missing** — the subplot is not assigned to this scene.
    *   **Gray** — the subplot is assigned but is not dominant.
    *   **Darker hue** of the subplot ring color — this subplot is dominant and expressed on the outer ring above all others.
*   **Reset**: Use **Settings → Core → Configuration → Reset subplot color precedence** to clear all manually assigned dominance.

This mode hides status and publishing stage overlays to keep the focus on story structure and the weaving of subplots.
