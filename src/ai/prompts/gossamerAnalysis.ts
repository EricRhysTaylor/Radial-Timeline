PREVIOUS ANALYSIS:
You previously analyzed this manuscript and assigned momentum scores to each beat (shown above as "Previous Score" and "Previous Justification"). 

Re-evaluate the manuscript with fresh eyes. You may:
- Confirm your previous scores if they still seem accurate
- Adjust scores up or down based on deeper understanding
- Refine your justifications for greater clarity

Your new analysis should reflect your best current judgment of the manuscript's momentum.

  const prompt = `You are analyzing narrative momentum across a full manuscript using the ${beatSystem} beat system.

BEAT STRUCTURE:
${beatList}

MOMENTUM SCALE (0-100):
- 0-20: Quiet, establishing, low tension
- 21-40: Building, complications emerging
- 41-60: Rising stakes, conflict developing
- 61-80: High tension, major conflicts
- 81-100: Peak tension, climactic moments

${previousAnalysisSection}TASK:
Read the full manuscript below and evaluate the narrative momentum at each story beat. For each beat, assign a momentum score (0-100) that reflects the tension, stakes, and emotional intensity at that point in the story.

Consider:
- Tension and conflict level
- Stakes for protagonist
- Emotional intensity
- Pacing and urgency
- Reader engagement
