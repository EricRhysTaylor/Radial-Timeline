Then create a new note with this template using the Command `Create advanced note`. Or via Book designer.\r\n- **Story Beat Editor**: Edit the custom story beats in settings. Create new beats. Set the Name, Act placement. Reorder. Create.\r\n- **Alien Planet Calendar**:  Track the time in faraway (inter-planetary) time zones. View it using ALT sub-mode in Chronologue Mode.\r\n- **Act Structure Customization**: Now you can have 5 Acts or 7 or more with custom names via Settings customization.\r\n- **Book Designer**: The new modal (accessible from the new Welcome Screen or Command Palette) will let you setup a new story scaffold quickly with mini preview-timeline. Use basic or advance yaml, adjust time increment, set the Acts and  more.\r\n- **New Welcome Screen**: A redesigned welcome screen for new projects (no scenes), featuring better orientation and direct links to resources and the Book Designer button.\r\n\r\n###  Enhanced & Bugs\r\n- **Restyled Modals**: Every single modal in the plugin has been harmonized with a consistent, polished design.\r\n- **Local LLM**: More options and better integration for working with local AI models. Still a work in progress.\r\n- **Chronologue Backdrop Styling**: Updated styles for Alt and Shift backdrop interactions ([8d627a1](https://github.com/EricRhysTaylor/Radial-Timeline/commit/8d627a1c2f4d5950b386e7decb358a7aabbac3e0)).\r\n- **Backdrop Time Alignment**: Now correctly aligns with corresponding scene time indexes in outer ring ([73e0cc0](https://github.com/EricRhysTaylor/Radial-Timeline/commit/73e0cc0f57d623e8efd686dc4a6491690b0639c1)).\r\n- **Tooltips**: New tooltip styling using Obsidian bubbles ([b21e870](https://github.com/EricRhysTaylor/Radial-Timeline/commit/b21e87031ea519db8618a7a1071a8762a8b677c6)).\r\n\r\n",
